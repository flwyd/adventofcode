# Trevor Stone's Advent of Code Repository

This is a repository containing solutions for
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Each AoC year has its own directory
and the solution for each day is in its own subdirectory. Each day also has
`input.example.txt`, taken from the problem description and the same for all
participants, and `input.actual.txt`, specific to my AoC user. If you’d like to
compare my output to yours, make sure to use the same input file for both.

I generally use Advent of Code as an opportunity to get experience with a
language that I don’t yet know well. You’re welcome to take inspiration from the
way I solved a problem, but please don’t assume that I’ve solved it in the most
idiomatic, efficient, or readable way.

accept pull requests to this repo, but you’re welcome to point out anything you
think could be done better.

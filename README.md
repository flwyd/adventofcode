# Trevor Stone's Advent of Code Repository

This is a repository containing solutions for
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Each AoC year has its own directory
and the solution for each day is in its own subdirectory. Each day also has
`input.example.txt`, taken from the problem description and the same for all
participants, and `input.actual.txt`, specific to my AoC user. If you’d like to
compare my output to yours, make sure to use the same input file for both. Each
day’s solution is generally a standalone program which takes input either on
standard input (2020) or one or more input files on the command line (2021).

I generally use Advent of Code as an opportunity to get experience with a
language that I don’t yet know well. You’re welcome to take inspiration from the
way I solved a problem, but please don’t assume that I’ve solved it in the most
idiomatic, efficient, or readable way.
